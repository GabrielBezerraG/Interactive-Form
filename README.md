## My Process
This application was developed entirely using React, JavaScript, CSS and HTML. I started the project using create-react-app and from there I built one main component on App.js and its child components. The main component is a stateful class component that passes state properties and methods to the child components. Every input in the form is a controlled component that receives state properties and is formatted using regular expressions. All fields are validated once the confirm button is clicked. If a given input is in a wrong format, it automatically renders an error message. This reactive behavior was achieved using setState for every input value, along with conditional rendering.
